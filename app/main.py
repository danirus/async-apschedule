# This function uses blocking to operate on files using the shutil and os
# packages. The interesting thing of the function is that in the next function
# (process_file) we run it within an executor, so that it can be used in the
# event loop of asyncio. It has more cost in terms of switching contexts due to
# the use of a Thread to run it, but it has the benefit that the copy and
# delete can be done in a non-blocking way allowing the rest of the tasks in
# the event loop to have a chance to run.

# This is the worker function of which we create 3 tasks that run in the event
# loop. The function reads from the queue until there is no more elements.
# When it reaches the end of the queue the function await in the queue.get(),
# so in the caller (check_inbox_dir method) we collect them and cancel them.
#
# The interesting part of the function is the usage of an executor in
# loop.run_in_executor. When the first arg is None the executor uses a
# ThreadPoolExecutor. I pass the name of the sync function I want to run in the
# executor (which is coded above these lines) and the argument I pass to the
# function, which is the filename I got from the queue.
